# Discord God Eyes

Discod God Eyes is a simple moderation tool I created for Aggregating all the messages from your server into one channel for easier moderation of multiple channels with mobile moderators in particular in mind.

_(Reacting to a message deletes it from the source channel, the bot replies with the ðŸ—‘ emoji to let you know it cleaned up the message.)_

## Installation

For the easiest setup I recommend using the DigitalOcean deploy button below then following the steps to get the enviroment variables as stated below.

[![Deploy to DO](https://www.deploytodo.com/do-btn-blue-ghost.svg)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps/new?repo=https://github.com/eeveeboo/discord-god-eyes/tree/master&refcode=6d2df0a41f28)

Or if you're more advanced you can build the image yourself or pull the auto-built one from my repo on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/eeveeboo/discord-god-eyes)

## Enviroment Variables Setup

To use this app you first need to create a discord bot through the discord developer portal

place the bot token as the DISCORD_TOKEN env variable

Add the bot to your server with permission to see channels, messages and manage messages

next create a "god-eyes" channel or whatever you want to call it. Make sure it's locked behind your moderator role!!

in that "god-eyes" channel open it's settings then click "Integrations" and create a web hook

place web hook url as the WEBHOOK_URL env variable

finally grab the ID of your server and place it in the GUILD_ID env variable

From there just start up the container and you're good to go!
